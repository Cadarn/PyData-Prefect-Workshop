# PyData London 2024 - PrefectWorkshop

To participate fully in this workshop you will need the following:
1. A Python environment (I will be using Python 3.12 but everything should work with a recent version of Python)
    - Install the libraries listed in `requirements.txt`
3. A local install of Docker; we will use Docker to run some additional services locally
    - Pull a copy of the PostgreSQL v13 image
    - Pull a copy of python:3.11-slim image 
4. Create an account on [Upstash](https://upstash.com/) - you will only need the free tier
    - You will need to create a free Kafka cluster
5. Create an account on [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas/register) - we will be using the free tier again
